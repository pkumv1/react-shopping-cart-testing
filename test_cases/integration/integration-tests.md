# React Shopping Cart Integration Tests

This document contains test cases for integration testing of the React Shopping Cart application.

## Test Case Categories

Integration tests verify interactions between combined components and ensure they work together as expected.

## Test Cases

**Description:** Verify that updates to the cart correctly affect the product list.

**Test Type:** Integration

**Priority:** High

**Preconditions:**
- App is running at http://localhost:3000

**Test Steps:**
1. Visit the home page
2. Add a product to the cart
3. Remove the product from the cart
4. Verify the product in the list doesn't show as added
5. Verify the cart counter updates correctly

**Expected Results:**

### TC-INT-003: Filter and Cart Integration

**Description:** Verify that filtering products doesn't affect the cart contents.

**Test Type:** Integration

**Priority:** Medium

**Preconditions:**
- App is running at http://localhost:3000

**Test Steps:**
1. Visit the home page
2. Add several products to the cart with different sizes
3. Apply a size filter that excludes some products in the cart
4. Verify the cart still contains all the added products
5. Verify the cart subtotal remains correct

**Expected Results:**
- Filtering products doesn't remove products from the cart
- Cart maintains correct state independent of applied filters

### TC-INT-004: Multiple Component State Consistency

**Description:** Verify that the application maintains consistent state across components.

**Test Type:** Integration

**Priority:** High

**Preconditions:**
- App is running at http://localhost:3000

**Test Steps:**
1. Visit the home page
2. Add multiple products to the cart
3. Apply filters and sorting
4. Remove a product from the cart
5. Verify all component states remain consistent
6. Refresh the page
7. Verify state consistency is maintained

**Expected Results:**
- All components display consistent data
- State is maintained consistently across the app
- Global app state is properly synchronized

### TC-INT-005: Context API Integration

**Description:** Verify that the Context API correctly shares state between components.

**Test Type:** Integration

**Priority:** High

**Preconditions:**
- App is running at http://localhost:3000

**Test Steps:**
1. Visit the home page
2. Add products to the cart
3. Verify cart data in the Context (using React DevTools)
4. Change state in one component
5. Verify that changes propagate to other components correctly

**Expected Results:**
- Context API correctly shares state between components
- State changes in one component affect other components correctly
- No state inconsistencies occur

### TC-INT-006: API and Component Integration

**Description:** Verify that components correctly handle and display API data.

**Test Type:** Integration

**Priority:** High

**Preconditions:**
- App is running at http://localhost:3000

**Test Steps:**
1. Visit the home page
2. Verify product data is loaded from the API (or mock data)
3. Verify components render API data correctly
4. Verify all product images load correctly

**Expected Results:**
- Components correctly consume and display API data
- All data from API is rendered properly
- No errors occur when rendering API data

### TC-INT-007: Error Handling Integration

**Description:** Verify that components handle errors correctly across the application.

**Test Type:** Integration, Error Handling

**Priority:** Medium

**Preconditions:**
- App is running at http://localhost:3000

**Test Steps:**
1. Intercept API calls and force error responses
2. Verify the application handles errors gracefully
3. Verify error states are communicated to the user
4. Verify the UI doesn't break when errors occur

**Expected Results:**
- Application displays appropriate error messages
- UI remains functional when errors occur
- Error state is consistent across components

### TC-INT-008: Session Persistence Integration

**Description:** Verify that cart data persists correctly across the application.

**Test Type:** Integration

**Priority:** Medium

**Preconditions:**
- App is running at http://localhost:3000

**Test Steps:**
1. Visit the home page
2. Add products to the cart
3. Verify cart data is stored in localStorage or sessionStorage
4. Refresh the page
5. Verify cart state is restored correctly
6. Verify all components reflect the persisted state

**Expected Results:**
- Cart data is correctly persisted
- All components show correct state after refresh
- No data loss occurs during persistence

## Accessibility Integration Testing

### TC-INT-101: Cross-Component Accessibility

**Description:** Verify that the application maintains accessibility across component interactions.

**Test Type:** Integration, Accessibility

**Priority:** High

**Preconditions:**
- App is running at http://localhost:3000

**Test Steps:**
1. Visit the home page
2. Test keyboard navigation across components
3. Verify focus management when moving between components
4. Verify screen reader announcements for state changes
5. Verify aria attributes are consistent across components

**Expected Results:**
- Focus correctly transfers between components
- Screen readers announce state changes
- Aria attributes are consistent and accurate
- No accessibility barriers exist between components

## Security Integration Testing

### TC-INT-201: Cross-Component Data Security

**Description:** Verify that data is securely handled across components.

**Test Type:** Integration, Security

**Priority:** High

**Preconditions:**
- App is running at http://localhost:3000

**Test Steps:**
1. Visit the home page

- No XSS vulnerabilities exist across components
- Inputs are validated and sanitized

## Performance Integration Testing

### TC-INT-301: Multi-Component Performance

**Description:** Verify performance across multiple interacting components.

**Test Type:** Integration, Performance

**Priority:** Medium

**Preconditions:**
- App is running at http://localhost:3000

**Test Steps:**
1. Visit the home page
2. Measure loading time for all components
3. Measure time for interactions that affect multiple components
4. Verify performance under high load conditions

**Expected Results:**
- Application remains responsive during complex operations
- State changes propagate efficiently between components
- No performance bottlenecks exist in component interactions
